# Bus-Service-Simulation
Simulation of the bus system by generating exponentially distributed  random events for the passengers arriving at Bus Stop.

Simulation is performed for the busses which are arriving at same time and distributed uniformly along the route.

Below are the events which are taken into consideration while performing simulation :

1. Arrival of the busses at bus stops.
2. Boarder baording the bus.
3. Person arrving at bus stop which is distributed exponentially.

Observations
1. As time passes the distance between the busses changed and after 8 hours of simulation, all busses arrived at the same stop and the poeple waiting at the bus stops
increased over time.
2. Experiments are performed for different scenarios to keep the distance between the busses unifrom and to observe the minimum, maximum and average number of people 
   waiting at each bus stop.
   
Experiments
1. Board the number of people at every bus stop which is equal to the average of all the queues at bus stops.
2. Stop all the busses at bus stop for only inter arrival rate time of the person arriving at bus stop.
3. Board the number of people which is equal to the minimum of all the queues at bus stops.
