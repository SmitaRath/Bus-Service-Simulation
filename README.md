# Bus-Service-Simulation
Simulation of the bus system by generating exponentially distributed  random events for the passengers arriving at Bus Stop.

Simulation is performed for the buses which are arriving at same time and distributed uniformly along the route.

Below are the events which are taken into consideration while performing simulation :

1. Arrival of the buses at bus stops.
2. Boarder baording the bus.
3. Person arrving at bus stop which is distributed exponentially.

Observations
1. As time passes the distance between the buses changed and after 8 hours of simulation, all buses arrived at the same stop and the poeple waiting at the bus stops
increased over time.
2. Experiments are performed for different scenarios to keep the distance between the buses unifrom and to observe the minimum, maximum and average number of people 
   waiting at each bus stop.
